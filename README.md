A payment card number, primary account number (**PAN**), or simply a card number, is the card identifier found on payment cards, such as credit cards and debit cards, as well as stored-value cards, gift cards and other similar cards. In some situations the card number is referred to as a bank card number. The card number is primarily a card identifier and does not directly identify the bank account number/s to which the card is/are linked by the issuing company.

The card number prefix identifies the issuer of the card, and the digits that follow are used by the issuing organization to identify the cardholder as a customer and which is then associated by the issuing organization with the customer's designated bank accounts.

In the case of stored-value type cards, the association with a particular customer is only made if the prepaid card is reloadable. Card numbers are allocated in accordance with [ISO/IEC 7812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7812).
